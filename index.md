# Welcome to Blog of Harish Lab

At Harish Lab, we push the boundaries of computational science and engineering by developing advanced numerical methods for solving complex multiphysics problems. Our research focuses on finite element methods (FEM), finite volume methods, graph neural networks, and uncertainty quantification, applied to high-precision engineering challenges in biomedical and sustainable space technologies.

## Our Research
- **Computational Mechanics:** We develop novel FEM and FVM techniques to simulate real-world engineering problems with high accuracy.
- **Machine Learning for Scientific Computing:** We integrate data-driven approaches, including graph neural networks, to enhance numerical methods.
- **Parallel and High-Performance Computing:** We implement large-scale solvers using Eigen, OpenMP, MPI, and domain decomposition to maximize efficiency.
- **Applications:** Our work is applied in cutting-edge fields, from biomechanics (tissue modeling, medical devices) to space engineering (tensegrity structures, sustainable materials).
