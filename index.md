# Welcome to Blog of Harish Lab

At Harish Lab, we push the boundaries of computational science and engineering by developing advanced numerical methods for solving complex multiphysics problems. Our research focuses on finite element methods (FEM), finite volume methods, graph neural networks, and uncertainty quantification, applied to high-precision engineering challenges in biomedical and sustainable space technologies.
