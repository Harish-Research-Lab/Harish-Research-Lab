I work with students and often some of them would like to pursue masters/Ph.D. In this regard, they would like reference letters to supper their applications. I wanted to put out some guidance and thoughts about writing reference letters. I feel that this is important to ensure that: (a) My colleagues understand the process (b) Find value in the reference letters © Most importantly, supports the students to help their careers.

## When to ask?
Please send a request atleast 4 weeks in advance of your first deadline. This provide me the much needed time to think deeply and write a coherent letter. The process of writing a letter takes multiple sittings and hence providing the time only makes it better.

**Note:** I would like to write a letter that helps and hence if the request comes with the first deadline in less than four weeks, I cannot write you a letter. 

## Will I write you a letter?
I will write you a letter iff you fall into one of the below categories:
- If I am your academic advisor and we have had sufficient contact time, I can write a letter that would provide the committee some context about your academic grades. Hence, please consider this as a supplementary letter that supports other stronger letters from supervisors who might have mentored you in research, internships and other industrial placements.
- If you were a student in one of my courses at the university level. I would be able to write you a letter only if we have had sufficient contact time and discussions to provide me an understanding about your thinking. If you were in my class but never walked down the aisle to talk to me, then this does not give me much data to comment on your technical ability.
- If we have worked together and published one or more journal paper.
- If I was a reviewer on your thesis — bachelor (last 3 years) / master or Ph.D. (last 5 years)
- If I was your Ph.D supervisor or co-supervisor, you have my support for eternity.
- If I have supervised your bachelor / masters thesis (last 5 years)
- If I supervised you directly on an intern project of 3–6 months duration: (a) During in the last one year (b) During the last two years and have published a journal paper or have already sent me a first draft

I do not think that in other cases, I would have enough material for a thorough assessment to write an excellent letter that can be beneficial to your application. I would not write one if I cannot provide you an excellent letter. Note that a mediocre letter can hurt your chances more & I would suggest you look for alternatives. There can always be exceptions but most students, for whom I have written a letter, fall into one of the above categories.

## What information (scanned copies) do you need to send in your request email?
Your email to request a reference letter should include all the below items to give me a holistic picture to write your reference letter.
- Your detailed CV including complete name and contact information (as listed in your applications)
- List of course projects, external projects and publications
- Up to date transcripts of all your course work (Bachelor / Master / Ph.D.). Please highlight here the specific courses that are relevant to your area of application
- External courses that you have completed
- GRE & TOEFL score sheets (as applicable)
- Statement of purpose
- **Bragsheet:** This is an bullet points of your accomplishments. This can be listed in two sub-sections: (a) General accomplishments (b) More importantly, what is that you did when working with me (like highlights of your research, grades in your HW / project / exam etc.). Be generous to yourself here.
- University and course information. Please see in the upcoming sections for more information

## What information about the courses & university should I send?
Please tabulate and send the below information along with the materials specified above.
- List of universities & departments where you are applying to
- The specific course program etc, if available or if this is a general MS / Ph.D. program in the department
- Specifics about the position — needed knowledge, skills, and experience
- In transcript, highlight the courses that you have completed and would be of relevance to this program that you are applying to.
- Deadlines for each university application
- Specify if the University has an online portal & if you would send me a link to upload or if this needs to be emailed to a course co-ordinator. If it is the latter, please specify the email address. Note: The email address need to be an official one rather than a gmail / yahoo address
- Highlight the courses that might have rolling admissions, as per your knowledge

## Does sending this information & request email mean that I will get a reference letter?
Once you send me the above information, I will ascertain if I have enough information to write a letter that can be helpful. I will need 7–10 working days for this process. If I am willing to write a reference letter, I will schedule a meeting with you to discuss your interests and application process.

## When will these letters be submitted?
Once I have replied positively and we have had a meeting, it will take me a while to make the first ready draft. I will let you know once the first letter has been submitted. This is likely to happen in close proximity to your first deadline. Subsequently, rest of the letters will be submitted as and when I receive the requests.
How will these letters be sent?

The letters are generally sent directly to the department / university via their official portal. Alternatively, I can also email it to the course coordinator, if the university does not have an official portal. In such a case, please do provide the official (non-generic email i.e. no gmail / yahoo) email address of the course co-ordinator.
I am applying to a country where the student has to submit the letter & the above two does not work?

Then please give me the list of universities & coursework where you want me to provide you a letter for. The letters will be specifically written for this purpose.

## Is there a limit on the number of letters that you will provide?
I will submit a maximum of five letters per year for Internship / Master / Ph.D applications combined.

## I would like to see the letter as I don’t know if your letter will be good!
I have seen people write mediocre and bad letters. I think this is a cowardly way out of a situation. Instead, I think they should have just denied to write a letter. If I think I cannot write an excellent letter, I will not be writing you a letter. If you want to see the letter, just ask me & I will be happy to share a copy.

My strong recommendation is to never to request a letter from someone whom you think will not write a great letter. Mutual trust is a big part! If you cannot trust them with your applications, then you should not be working with them or taking their letters.
