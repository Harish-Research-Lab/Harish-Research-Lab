I would like to share some of my experiences in mentoring students and outline best practices. Please note that this article is inspired by one written by Jack Baker at Stanford (https://www.jackwbaker.com/advice/Meeting_with_your_advisor.html), but it is based on my own experiences.

Frequently, I observe that students feel highly stressed about meeting their advisors. It is essential to recognize the existence of abusive advisors in academia as the first step towards instigating change. In this article, I aim to present my perspective on the role of student-advisor meetings.

## Why do you wish to meet your advisor?
The most fundamental question to consider is, “Why would one want to meet their advisor?” Many students believe that it’s merely to report their progress and obtain approval for future plans. This reporting is viewed as a means of sustaining funding (for Ph.D. students) and maintaining grades (for undergraduate and master’s students).

However, I would like to emphasize that the primary reason should be to receive “constructive feedback.” While advisors are expected to provide this, it doesn’t always happen. We will discuss a hostile work environment separately. For now, let’s assume your advisor is reasonable and explore how to handle the situation.

## Meeting with your advisor and student stress points
Students often experience stress when it comes to advisor meetings. Common reasons that I have observed, and personally felt, include:
- Advisors might make personal remarks if there is less progress than anticipated. I don’t agree with this, but I understand that it happens in academia more often than we might think.
- Students are apprehensive that the advisor might believe the progress is not “up to mark.”
- There hasn’t been much progress to report because nothing has worked.
- The student was not able to accomplish much due to other commitments.
- The student simply did not feel like working that week, for whatever reason.

## What are the expectations for myself at the student meeting?
I aim to foster a professional environment that facilitates my students’ learning and growth in their careers. Here are some things that I strive to do:
- Restrict student meetings to Monday to Friday (10 am to 5 pm) to the best of my ability.
- Encourage Ph.D. students to attend at least one workshop or conference each year. I actively search for such opportunities and share them with students during our meetings.
- Encourage students to consider non-academic careers alongside academic endeavors. Involve them in industrial projects to help build their networks and share potential job openings.
- Set expectations for publishing papers, conference presentations, and writing recommendation letters. Provide feedback on these for timely submission.
- I acknowledge that I might not have all the answers. Together, we are pushing the boundaries of knowledge.

## What are students expected to bring?

### Progress reporting vs. discussion
Consider your advisor as a discussion partner rather than a boss to whom you report your progress. They want to learn from you, but if you do not engage, they will move on to the next project where they can learn. Therefore, it is more beneficial to think of your advisor as a person with whom you can discuss, teach them things they do not know, and learn what they know. It is a mutually beneficial and engaging relationship. Student-advisor relationships that do not reach their pinnacle are those where the student views it as a reporting exercise.

### Actions speak louder than words
Instead of telling me that you read five papers in the last week, explain to me what papers you read. Provide an outline of:
- Your understanding of the main takeaway points from these papers.
- Identify important equations and results, especially if they shared data/code (in today’s context).
- If they shared data/code, did you try to run these? Are there any relevant ones that you should run?
- What is innovative about this work in comparison to other papers you’ve read to date?

I might or might not be familiar with all these papers. I would like to understand the latest developments. I am happy to share my perspectives on those I have already read or promise to read the rest and get back to you.

### Trial and error does not mean “No Progress”
If you attempted ten different things last week, and none were successful, that is okay. I would like to know:
-What are the things you tried?
- What worked, and what did not?
- What was your logical reasoning for moving from one trial to another? For example, if you tried “A” and it didn’t work, what was the logical basis for considering idea “B”?

I will assist you in formulating whether this direction seems promising or if we should explore alternative approaches. However, to do that, I need to understand the direction of your thoughts. Without this, my advice might end up being counterproductive.

### Nothing just happened!
It is acceptable that there will be weeks when nothing significant occurs. You might be occupied with reading books, taking courses, feeling unwell, grieving, experiencing a break-up, procrastinating, or simply not being in the mood. All of these are acceptable reasons within certain bounds.

If you couldn’t accomplish anything, it’s better to be honest rather than trying to fabricate excuses to avoid the meeting. I understand that we are all human beings. However, it becomes a cause for concern if this happens regularly. In such a case, I will raise an alarm to indicate that you might need to reassess and regain control.

### Proactive vs. reactive
Propose a plan for the next steps (weeks/months), depending on the nature (bachelor/master/Ph.D.) of the project. Students are expected to proactively drive their projects by suggesting ideas for the way forward. It is my responsibility to often play the devil’s advocate to ensure that the student has thoroughly thought this through. If there are gaps in their thoughts, I aim to help identify these so that they can be addressed.

However, in some cases, if I perceive that the students do not have a reasonable plan, I would suggest one. In such a situation, it is expected that the student can explore this direction and report back in the next meeting before further charting their own course of action.

### Administrative tasks
Create a list of administrative tasks for which you would like assistance from me. If you have already initiated any, please provide details on what you have done.

### Follow-up email
- Send me a short follow-up email with bullet points highlighting items that you would like assistance with. I do my best not to forget, but a reminder is always helpful.
- Conclusion

Overall, my goal is to provide constructive and timely feedback. I believe that this is most effective when students think of the meetings as a discussion rather than reporting or expecting the advisor to do all the talking.
